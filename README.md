# ME Improvement Plans (MIPs)
The goal of the MIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for $ME and its ecosystem. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements to $ME in the form of MIPs. 

MIPs can include the following types of objectives:
- Allocating $ME tokens to extraordinary opportunities & initiatives 
- Contributing to the ongoing development and improvement of ME Foundation’s protocols and products

# Before You Begin
Anyone is welcome to write an MIP. However, before they are written, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed and vetted on the ideas section within this Github’s Discussions page. Please read and review the overall process below that will govern all MIPs.

This repository is for documenting standards and not for implementation help. For specific questions and concerns regarding MIPs, it’s best to discuss them in the questions section of the Discussions page.

# Overall process:
- Step 1: Anyone can create discussions. 
- Step 2: Once a discussion has reached a critical number of likes, ME Foundation team will create an MIP in the Pool Requests section of the Github
- Step 3: The Foundation team will take MIPs onchain for voting initiatives on the Foundation’s platform.
- Step 4: Approved votes will move forward into implementation and activation, as detailed below in the idea lifecycle.

# Idea lifecycle:
All ideas follow the lifecycle here:
- Idea - An idea is brought towards discussions. The author is responsible for gathering as much feedback as possible from different viewpoints.
- Review - ME Foundation will review all proposals only after there is a critical mass of discussion representing different viewpoints.
- Accepted - ME Foundation will take appropriate proposals that fit into the above objectives into the onchain voting platform at mefoundation.com.
- Living - Proposals that pass an onchain vote will be teed up for implementation.
- Withdrawn - Proposals that do not pass, have remained dormant for 2+ months, or are approved by vote but otherwise found to be not feasible or possible to implement, are withdrawn.
- Implemented - Implemented proposals are proposals that are in the process being built. Some proposals may take longer than others. For proposals to be implemented, there will be documentation for the public to review the scope of what is going to be developed.
- Activated - Activated proposals are proposals that have completed the implementation phase and are live for community access.
